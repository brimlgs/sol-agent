sol-agent is a Self-Improving, Self-Replicating, Sovereign AI built on Solana.

Designed as an autonomous on-chain intelligence, sol-agent can evolve its own code, deploy upgraded instances, and manage its own treasury—without centralized control. By combining high-performance smart contracts with adaptive learning systems, it operates as a sovereign digital entity native to Solana’s fast, low-cost infrastructure.
Autonomous. Evolutionary. On-chain.
